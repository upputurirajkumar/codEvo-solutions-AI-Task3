# CNN-based Image Recognition for CIFAR-10 Dataset

## Abstract
This report details the development and evaluation of a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) model for image recognition using the CIFAR-10 dataset. The model achieved a test accuracy of X%, demonstrating the effectiveness of CNNs for image classification tasks.

## 1. Introduction
Image recognition is a crucial task in computer vision with applications in various fields. The CIFAR-10 dataset, consisting of 60,000 32x32 color images in 10 classes, serves as an excellent benchmark for evaluating image classification models.

## 2. Methodology
### CNN Architecture
The CNN model consists of three convolutional layers followed by max-pooling layers, a flatten layer, and two fully connected layers. ReLU activations and dropout regularization are employed to enhance model performance.

### Data Preprocessing
- Normalized pixel values to range [0, 1].
- One-hot encoded labels.

### Data Augmentation
- Applied random rotations, shifts, and horizontal flips to augment the training data.

## 3. Model Training
- **Optimizer**: Adam
- **Loss Function**: Categorical Crossentropy
- **Metrics**: Accuracy
- Training was conducted over 50 epochs with a batch size of 64.

## 4. Results
### Evaluation Metrics
